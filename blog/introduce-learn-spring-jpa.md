Master Spring Data JPA and boots your productivity with a modern persistence framework.
掌握Spring Data JPA，用现代持久性框架来提高你的生产力

## Why Choose the Spring Ecosystem for Persistence(为什么在持久性方面选择Spring生态)

One of the main goals of Spring has always been to increase developer productivity,and the Spring Data project is 
certainly no exception.(Spring的主要目标之一就是提高开发者的生产力，Spring Data项目当然也不例外)

The framework has native support for the standards in the Java ecosystem--JPA/Hibernate,among a multitude of other 
persistence technologies.(该框架对于Java生态系统中的标准--JPA/Hibernate 以及其他许多持久化技术，都有着原生支持)

Spring Data JPA sits on top of JPA and simplifies common data access operations,while also enhancing the JPA support 
with new,powerful functionalities.(Spring Data JPA基于Java JPA封装，简化了常见的数据访问操作，同时还通过新的、强大的功能来增强对JPA的支持)

All this makes Spring Data JPA great choice for building a powerful,yet clean persistence layer,while minimizing 
boilerplate code.(所有的这些都使得Spring Data JPA成为创建一个强大而又简介的持久层的最佳选择，同时最大限度地先少了模板代码)

## Learn Spring Data JPA through Practical Examples

And,while the Spring ecosystem is quite large and moving fast,the core persistence functionally is actually super 
stable.(而且，虽然Spring生态系统相当庞大，发展迅速，但Spring核心的持久性功能实际上是超级稳定的)

Learning Spring Data means--learning the framework that sits on top pf JPA and Hibernate and builds on both of these 
with Spring-centric functionally.(学习Spring Data意味着，是在学习位于JPA和Hibernate之上的框架，并以Spring为中心的功能是建立在两者之上的)

Of course,we'll start by understanding the how and why of Spring Data,then look into the best use of its features to 
quickly build a strong data access layer

## Leaning Spring Data JPA,step by step

In each module,you'll be build actual code.The lessons go over the theory and follow up with practical code examples.
This is also my first text-based course.Not doing video on this one from the start will be a great way to open up 
the material much sooner and also make it my very first course prices close to 100$

Each of the 2 classes below feature a different level of education.

## The Master Class

The material goes over the most popular Spring data JPA features,while diving into the inner-working of the framework.

The 6 modules focus on the core aspects of the framework,from generating repository to custom queries,pagination,
auditing and more,while using Spring 5 and Spring Boot 2

## The Certification Class

This class is simple--it contains the full material form the Mater Class,plus multiple--choice questions after each 
lesson--to make sure you fully understand the material.When you're done,you'll get a "Certificate of Completion" of 
the course.

Actual coding practice through a real-world project--is the best way to learn a complex framework such as Spring 
Data JPA

## Practice by Coding

The lesson start with fundamentals of how Spring Data works and generating simple repositories,and quickly guide you 
through the more advanced features pf the framework.

I'm Eugen,and I'll be your instructor through this course.

I've worked in the java ecosystem for well over a decade now,and with JPA for almost as much.With the advent of 
Spring Data,I've seen how much cleaner JPA implementations can now be.

The lessons here come out of that experience,with a very simple goal--to guide you through Spring's flagship 
persistence framework--Spring Data JPA.Of course,you'll need to code along with the lesson,each step of the way.The 
lessons and exercises are your reference to come back to whenever you need them.

The text-based material if focused on building out the essential persistence Layer of an application,with the help 
of Spring Data JPA.If you're new to Spring,have a look at the "Learn Spring" course first.

## Introduce the Master Class

The canonical reference for learning Spring Data JPA with Spring Boot 2.The 6 modules cover everything form the 
basic configuration,creating repositories,customizing queries,and using native SQL.Simple put,the core 
functionality you need to create your persistence layer.

In addition to the core aspects,we'll also look at more advanced features like projections,specifications,auditing 
and events,to make full use of the framework.

Everything I wish I had access to when I build mu first persistence project with Spring.
