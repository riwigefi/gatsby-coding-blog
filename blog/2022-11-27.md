## Spring MVC

- MODEL: Simple POJO(Plain Old Java Object) with collection of properties which may or many not be used by the view
- VIEW: Data as requested by the client.Implemented with JSP,Jackson,etc.Can be HTML,JSON,XML,text.etc.
- CONTROLLER: Java class implemented to handle request mapping.Should be a "traffic cop" and contain minimal business logic.Typically works in conjunction with a service,which contains business logic.

## Spring Controllers

Annotate Controller Class with @Controller

This will register the class as a Spring Bean and as a Controller in Spring MVC.

To map methods to heep request paths use `@RequestMapping`

## Software Layers

- Views:

1. JSP with custom tags
2. web-jars
3. BootStrap(CSS)
4. custom LESS

- Controller

1. Spring @MVC Annotations
2. Bean Validation

- Service

1. @Cache-able
2. @Transactional

- Repository: 3 Spring profiles

1. Spring Data JPA
2. JPA(Default)
3. JDBC(Java Database Connectivity)Java 连接到数据库的实现

## Debounce

Debouncing is a technique used to control how many times we allow a function to be executed over time.
When a JavaScript function is debounced with a wait time of X milliseconds,it must wait until after X milliseconds have 
elapsed since the debounced function was called.You almost certainly have encountered debouncing in your daily lives 
before -- when entering an elevator.Only after X duration of not pressing the "Door Open" button(the debounced 
function not being called) will the elevator door actually close(the callback is executed).

Implement a `debounce` function which accepts a callback function and a `wait` duration.Calling `debounce()` returns 
a function which has debounce invocations of the callback function following the behavior described above
