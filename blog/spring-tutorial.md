The **Spring Framework** is a mature,powerful and highly flexible framework focused on building web applications in 
Java.(Spring是一个成熟、强大又高度灵活的框架，在Java生态体系中专注于构建Web应用)

One of the core benefits of Spring is that it takes care of most of the low-level aspects of building the 
application to allow us to actually focus on feature and business logic.(Spring的核心优势之一是它处理了构建应用程序的大部分
低层次的问题，使得开发者能够真正地专注于业务逻辑)

Another strong points is that,while the framework is quite mature and well-established,it's very actively maintained 
and has a thriving dev community.This makes it quite uo to date and aligned with Java ecosystem right now.
(Spring的另一个优点是，即使它已经相当成熟和完善，但是它的维护依然非常积极，拥有一个活跃繁荣的开发社区。开发社区使得它与时俱进，能够和现在的
Java生态的发展保持一致)

Of course,there's a lot to learn to work well with Spring.(当然，要很好地应用Spring框架，有很多东西需要学习)

Let's get started.(让我们开始吧)

## Spring on the Web

The Spring MVC framework is the foundation of building web applications with Spring.

It powers a wide range of web applications,from traditional MVC-style applications,wll the way to stateless REST APIs.

Let's start with some basics--the common ground between all of these styles of web applications.

- [Spring Web Annotations]
- [@RequestMapping in Spring(popular)]
- [Spring @RequestParam Annotation(popular)]
- [The Spring @Controller and @RestController Annotations]
- [Spring's RequestBody and ResponseBody Annotations(popular)]

And then,the basics of building a traditional,MVC-style web application:

- [Spring MVC Tutorial]
- [The @ModelAttribute Annotation]
- [A Guide to the ViewResolver]
- [Getting Started with Forms]
- [Introduction to using Thymeleaf in Spring]
- [Model,ModelMap,and ModelView]

And,if you'd like to explore the Spring MVC framework more in-depth,here's a more comprehensive guide to do that.

Finally,let's explore the REST-ful support in Spring MVC:

- [Bootstrapping a Web Application]
- [Building a REST API]
- [Securing a REST API]
- [Basic and Digest Authentication for a REST API]
- [REST Pagination]
- [Entity To DTO Conversion for a Spring REST API]
- [Spring's RequestBody and ResponseBody Annotations(popular)]
- [Error Handling for REST with Spring(popular)]
- [Max-HTTP-Header-Size in Spring Boot 2]

And,if you'd like to further explore building a REST API with Spring,you can go through [the more full-fledged 
series of articles here]
