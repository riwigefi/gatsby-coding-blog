This is my third blog post! Isn't it _great_?

Some of my **favorite** things are:

- Petting dogs
- Singing
- Eating potato-based foods

## Code Highlight

This some Code

```js
const a = 'Hello JavaScript';
```

I don’t know how to solve this. But I didn’t add this system in the first place, so I’m probably not the best person to solve it. All I know is it’s horribly broken.

There are a few possible solutions that I have seen.

Offer some way to counter-claim vulnerability reports. The problem is not entirely unknown to Node.js and npm, of course. Different people have worked on different suggestions to fix it. For example, there is a proposal for a way to manually resolve audit warnings so that they don’t display again. However, this still places the burden on app users, which don’t necessarily have context on what vulnerabilities deeper in the tree are real or bogus. I also have a proposal: I need a way to mark for my users that a certain vulnerability can’t possibly affect them. If you don’t trust my judgement, why are you running my code on your computer? I’d be happy to discuss other options too.
